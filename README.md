Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analysis

This tableau story captures Citi Bike Activity in NYC from June 2019. 

Customers appear to have longer trip durations than subscribers to the Citi Bike service. This may be due to different rates that are afforded to each type of customer.
Average trip duration appears to decrease slightly over time the older a customer is. However, 50 yr old and 84 yr old customers appear to be anomalies in the data.
Three of the 4 most active stations are in areas that are inlets of Manhattan from New Jersey and Other Borrows which suggests that Citi Bikes might be one leg of an average commuterâ€™s trip.
